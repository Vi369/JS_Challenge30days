## Day 3: Control Structures

### Approach and Thought Process

On Day 3, the goal is to understand and practice control structures in JavaScript, including `if-else`, nested `if-else`, `switch`, and the ternary operator.

#### Activity 1: if-else Statements

- I used `if-else` statements to make decisions in the code based on different conditions.
- For example, I checked if a provided number is positive, negative, or zero, and also checked if a user's age makes them eligible to vote.

#### Activity 2: Nested if-else Statements

- I used nested `if-else` statements to make decisions and check different conditions.
- For instance, determining the largest number among three given numbers.

#### Activity 3: Switch Case

- I used `switch` case statements to handle multiple scenarios/conditions more cleanly.
- For example, mapping day numbers to the corresponding day of the week and giving grades based on marks range.

#### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

- I used the conditional ternary operator `condition ? statement1 : statement2` to make decisions and check conditions.

#### Activity 5: Combining Conditions

- I used `if-else` statements to check multiple conditions and determine if a given year is a leap year.

### Achievements

By completing these activities, I have:

- Implemented and understood `if-else` and nested `if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilized `switch` cases to handle multiple scenarios or conditions based on specific values.
- Understood the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combined multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.
