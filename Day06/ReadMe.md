## Day 6: Functions

### Approach and Thought Process

On Day 6, the goal was to understand and practice Arrays creations manipulation using various methods and practice adavanced array methods such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

#### Activity 1: Array Creation and Access
there are serveral ways to create arrays in javascript.
 * Task is to create array so i used an Array literal to create a simple array of numbers.
 * Array indices start at 0 so i accessed the first element using `arr[0]` and used  `arr[arr.length -1]` to find  the last element;
#### Activity 2: Array Basic Methods
* I used the `push` method to add a new element to the end of the array.

* I used the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array.

* I used the `shift` method to remove the first element from the array.

* I used the `unshift` method to add a new element to the beginning of the array.
#### Activity 3: Array Methods (intermediate)
Approach is, I wanted to transform each element in the array to its squre using `map` method and create new array with the result.

* I used `map` method so i can iterate throuch each element of the array and apply transformatin function, which multiplies each element by itself.

Approach is, I needed to filter out only the even numbers from the array and create new array with all even num elements.

* I used `filter` method and check each element to see if it is divisible by 2 or not and include it in the new array if it passes this condition.

Approach is, Find the sum of all elements in the array using `reduce` method.

* with `reduce` method, i can accumulate the sum by iterating through the array, starting with an initial value of `0` , and adding each element to the accumulator.

#### Activity 4: Array Iteration
Approach is, I wanted to iterate array using `for` loop and `forEach` methods.

* The `for` loop allows manual control over the iteration process, while `forEach` provides a cleaner, more readable syntax for iterating over array elements. I used both one by one and console the each elements.
#### Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Array
Approach is, create and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays. and console specific element.

I used Array literal to create 2D array and console specific elements within the multi-dimensional array.

* A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays, where each element can be an array itself.

* By using nested loops, I can iterate through each element in a multi-dimensional array to access and manipulate the data. 

### Achievements 
By completing these activities, I aimed to:

* Gain and revise array creation and manipulations using various methods. And also gain practical experience in using advanced array methods.

* Understand how to transform and aggregate array data using `map` ,`filter`, and `reduce`.

* Learn the differences and use cases for iterating over arrays using `for` loop and `forEach`.

* Gain a foundational understanding of working with multi-dimensional arrays.

* Enhance problem-solving skills by applying these methods to common array operations.
