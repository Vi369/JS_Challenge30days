## Day 4: Loops

### Approach and Thought Process

On Day 4, the goal is to understand and practice loops in JavaScript, including `for` loops, `while` loops, `do...while` loops, nested loops, and loop control statements.

#### Activity 1: For Loop

- I used a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 and another `for` loop to print the multiplication table of 5.

#### Activity 2: While Loop

- I used a `while` loop to print the sum of numbers between 1 and 10, and also to print numbers from 10 to 1.

#### Activity 3: Do...While Loop

- I used a `do...while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5 and to calculate the factorial of a given number.

#### Activity 4: Nested Loop

- I used a nested loop to print a pyramid pattern with n levels.

#### Activity 5: Loop Control Statements

- I used a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, using `continue` to skip the number 5.
- I also used a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 and stop the loop when the number 7 is encountered, using the `break` keyword.

### Achievements

By completing these activities, I have:

- Understood and implemented `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops for various tasks.
- Utilized nested loops to solve more complex problems and print patterns.
- Applied loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to manage loop execution flow.
- Enhanced my problem-solving skills by practicing different loop structures in JavaScript.
