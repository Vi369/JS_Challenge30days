## Day 1: Variables and Data Types

### Approach and Thought Process

Day 1 of this challenge, my goal was to revisit the basics of javascript variables and data types.

#### Activity 1: variable declaration
* I start Declare variable using var and let assigning a number and a string.

* The difference between `let` and `var`. `var` is crucial : `var` allows for global scope declaration, while `let` provides more specific control within the block scope.

#### Activity 2: constant declaration
* constant value declare using `const` keyword it once assigned and locks the value it means we can't change the variable value again.

* when we declare const variable we immediate assign the value to ensure that once declared `const` value cannot reassigned or changed.

#### Activity 3: Data Types
* To Rainforce my understanding, I created diff types of data types (Number , string , boolean, Object, Array) and checked each type using typeof.

* `typeof number => number`
* `typeof string => string`
* `typeof boolean => boolean`
* `typeof Object => Object`
* `typeof Array => Object`

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables

using `let` I tried to changed value and found `let` variable is so flexiable we can changed the value again and again depending on the operations.

#### Activity 5: Understanding const

changing `const` variable which fire an error : This made it clear that `const` is for values that won't change.
