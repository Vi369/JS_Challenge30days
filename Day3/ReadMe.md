## Day 3 : Control Structures

### Approach and Thought Process
On Day 3, Goal is to understand and practice control structures in JavaScript, including if-else, nested if-else, switch, and the ternary operator.

#### Activity 1: if-else Statements

* I will use `if-else` statements to make decisions in the code based on diffrent conditions.

* For example: i check provided number is positive , negative or zero and also cheking if a user's age makes them eligiable to vote.

#### Activity 2: Nasted if-else Statements

* I will use `Nested if-else` statements to make decisions and check different conditions.
* for instance, determining lagest number among three given numbers.


#### Activity 3: Switch case 

* I will use `switch case` statements to handle multiple scenario/conditions more cleanly.

for Example, mapping day number to the corresponding day of the week and giving Garde based on the marks range.

#### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

I will use Conditional Ternary Operator ` condition ? statement1: statement 2`  to make dicision and check condition.

#### Activity 5: Combining Conditions

* I will use `if-else` statements to check multiple conditions and determining if a given year is a leap year.

### Achievements 

By the completing of these activities , i aim to 

* Implement and understand `if-else` and `Nasted if-else` statements and handle multiple conditions.

* Utilize `switch` cases to handle multiple scenario or condtions on specific values.

* understand ternary operator for concise condition checking.

* combining multiple conditions to solve more complex problem.
