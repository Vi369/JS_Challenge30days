## Day 1: Variables and Data Types

### Approach and Thought Process

On Day 1, the goal was to revisit the basics of JavaScript variables and data types.

#### Activity 1: Variable Declaration

- I started by declaring variables using `var` and `let`, assigning both numbers and strings.
- I explored the difference between `let` and `var`. `var` allows for global scope declaration, while `let` provides more specific control within block scope.

#### Activity 2: Constant Declaration

- I declared constant values using the `const` keyword. Once assigned, the value cannot be changed.
- When declaring a `const` variable, I immediately assigned the value to ensure that it cannot be reassigned or changed.

#### Activity 3: Data Types

- To reinforce my understanding, I created different types of data (Number, String, Boolean, Object, Array) and checked each type using `typeof`.
  - `typeof number` => `number`
  - `typeof string` => `string`
  - `typeof boolean` => `boolean`
  - `typeof object` => `object`
  - `typeof array` => `object`

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables

- Using `let`, I changed variable values and found `let` to be flexible, allowing values to be changed repeatedly depending on operations.

#### Activity 5: Understanding const

- I attempted to change `const` variables, which resulted in an error. This clarified that `const` is for values that won't change.

### Achievements

By completing these activities, I aimed to:

- Deepen my understanding of variable declaration using `var` and `let`.
- Gain clarity on JavaScript's variable scoping rules.
- Learn the importance and immutability of `const`.
- Build a solid foundation for tackling more complex JavaScript challenges in the future.
