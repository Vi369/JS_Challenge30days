## Day 5: Functions

### Approach and Thought Process

On Day 5, the goal was to understand and practice different types of functions in JavaScript, including function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, function parameters with default values, and higher-order functions.

#### Activity 1: Functions Declaration

* I started by defining simple functions using the `function` keyword.

* The `checkEvenOdd` function takes a number as an argument and checks whether it is even or odd, then logs the result to the console.

* The `squareNumber` function takes a number as an argument and returns its square.


#### Activity 2 : Functions Expression

* I assign a function to a variable `findMaximum`. This makes `findMaximum` variable a function expression.

* The function `findMaximum` takes two parameters and i used ternary operator to make decision and check condition which number is greater and console the result.

* Also create a function expression for concatenated two strings and return the result. 

#### Activity 3 : Arrow Functions

* I Practiced and created arrow functions, which offer a concise syntax for writing functions. Arrow function are very useful for short functions and callbacks, and they do not have their own `this` context, which can be benificial in certain situations.

* Using Arrow function I created a `sumOfTwoNum` function to calculate and console the sum of two numbers result.

* And also created an `isHas` arrow function to check strings contains that specific charater or not result will be `true` or `false`.


#### Activity 4 : Function Parameters and Default Values 

I created `productOfNumbers` function that takes two parameter and return their product, with the second parameter having default value if user not pass the second parameter so it will be used if user passed the second parameter value so it will be override.

* Also Created `greeting` function that greet user acording to their nage and age, with age having default value.


#### Activity 4 : Higher-Order Functions

* Higher order function that takes function as a parameter and also return a function.

* I created a function `callFunctionNTimes` that takes two paramerter function and number of times then execute/calls the function that many times.

* Created an `applyFunctions` function that takes two functions and a value, that value first apply on the first function and the first function result apply on the second function argument and this second function result return as a final result of this function.


### Achievements 
By completing these activities, I aimed to:

* Gain and revise practical experience with different types of functions.

* Understand and implement function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions.

* Learn how to use default parameters in functions.

* Explore higher-order functions and their applications.
